1-1-1: simple: In Python, switch the values of x and y: x, y = y, x other languages: temp = x; x = y; y = temp;
python中x和y交换： x,y=y,x 2.主流用法： 爬虫，大数据，测试，web，AI，脚本处理； python之禅： 3.Simple is better than complex. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. 收起
1-1-2. Popular: Crawler, big data, testing, web backend, AI, script.
1-2-1: What's framework：A framework is a set of pre-written code libraries designed to be used by developers. It increases developing speed and quality.
1-3-1: Python: simple, flexible灵活，elegance优雅
1-3-2: As a script language, JavaScript ES6 supports Object Oriented Programing, but Python is an OOP language since it was born.
1-4-1: #Compiled language(C, C++): compiled to machine code before run. #Interpreted programming language: JaveScript and Python. They compile to machine code when it's run. #Intermediate language: Jave and C# compiled to byte code bytecode (Java) and IL(C#) codes, then run on their virtual machine. 收起
1-4-2: Performance: operating slow, but developing fast. No language is better than other. Only better fit into a specific project.
1-6-1: #Web: Flash, Django; #Machine Learning: TensorFlow; #Glue language: Often use to glue different language modules together.
1-7-1: The code should be efficient and easy to understand.
1-7-2: Too many frameworks, libraries, techniques, but we should focus on the fundamental of a language.
